# FA_and_Price_Pridiction_for_handset
Feature prediction and price prediction for handsets of different companies and models.
There are different models with different features like memory,RAM, camera pixels and colors.
Based opon tghis feature their prices were change,and about to fing about which feature has its main role for the pricing.
Here use different algorithms for feature selection and pricing relation.
Different algorithms has their own benefits, but Random forest algorith plays vital role on price pridiction based on their feature.
And Memory is the most important feature that affects the handset price.
Here different some algorithms are also used like Linear regression and Decision tree.
